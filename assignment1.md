- Clarity and Accuracy:

  -  I was able to identify the central point that the reporter was trying to say. However, the headline is somewhat misleading. The insight this article aims to convey is that schools in predominantly black neighborhoods are among the worst in Florida, a point it discusses throughout the article. However, the headline was "One fateful decision. Years of neglect. Five once-average schools remade into the worst in Florida. FAILURE FACTORIES." In my opinion, the headline should have stated that they would be focusing on schools in particular black neighborhoods. My rating is 2 out of 5. 
  - There was no visual data provided in this article. All the data was presented simply.
  - I believe that some of the data was accurate. The author put where they got the information from. However, I think it would have been helpful to provide more details about where the data came from rather than just saying it simply like “The kids were horribly behind,” Mermelstein, 43, said in an interview with the *Times*. They mentioned the *Times* frequently, so I would suggest the reporter check that. Additionally, there were some parts where they added quotes from people without stating where or when this was said. For example, 'A certified teacher of elementary school children and non-native English speakers, she said her Lakewood students could barely read. “They should have been reading books with paragraphs. They should have been comprehending.' 'In 2014, 52 percent of the schools’ instructors requested transfers out.' They did not say where these statements came from, which heavily decreases the reliability of this information. My rating is a 2 out of 5.
- Quality:
    - The overall quality of the article was not that great. There were definitely a lot of improvements that needed to be made. The article did a decent job of explaining why schools in black neighborhoods are failing, and there was some reliable information that could prove their argument. However, the structure was quite unorganized. There were single small sentences as one paragraph. There was also information that could have been put in a paragraph, but was separated. There were also some grammatical mistakes. For example, at the beginning of the article, they were stating some information: "Eight in 10 fail reading, according to state standardized test scores. Nine in 10 fail math." They switched from words to numbers. There were also unnecessary hyphens when a comma could have been used instead. Additionally, there were parts of the article that seemed to stereotype black communities. This sentence, "First they abandoned integration, leaving the schools overwhelmingly poor and black". Saying the word 'black' at the end implies that struggling communities are equal to black communities. This is a highly negative stereotype that the article reinforced. My rating is a 2 out of 5.
