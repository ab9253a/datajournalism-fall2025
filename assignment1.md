# Article Critique

- Clarity and Accuracy:

  -  I was able to identify the central point that the reporter was trying to say. However, the headline is somewhat misleading. The insight this article aims to convey is that schools in predominantly black neighborhoods are among the worst in Florida, a point it discusses throughout the article. However, the headline was "One fateful decision. Years of neglect. Five once-average schools remade into the worst in Florida. FAILURE FACTORIES." In my opinion, the headline should have stated that they would be focusing on schools in particular black neighborhoods. My rating is 2 out of 5. 
  - There was no visual data provided in this article. All the data was stated simply.
  - I believe that some of the data was accurate. The author put where they got the information from. However, I think it would have been helpful to provide more details about where the data came from rather than just saying it simply like “The kids were horribly behind,” Mermelstein, 43, said in an interview with the *Times*. They mentioned the *Times* frequently, so I would suggest the reporter check that. Additionally, there were some parts where they added quotes from people without stating where or when this was said. For example, 'A certified teacher of elementary school children and non-native English speakers, she said her Lakewood students could barely read. “They should have been reading books with paragraphs. They should have been comprehending.' 'In 2014, 52 percent of the schools’ instructors requested transfers out.' They did not say where these statements came from, which heavily decreases the reliability of this information. My rating is a 2 out of 5.
- Quality:
    - The overall quality of the article was not that great. There were definitely a lot of improvements that needed to be made. The article did a decent job of explaining why schools in black neighborhoods are failing, and there was some reliable information that could prove their argument. However, the structure was quite unorganized. There were single small sentences as one paragraph. There was also information that could have been put in a paragraph, but was separated. There were also some grammatical mistakes. For example, at the beginning of the article, they were stating some information: "Eight in 10 fail reading, according to state standardized test scores. Nine in 10 fail math." They switched from words to numbers. There were also unnecessary hyphens when a comma could have been used instead. Additionally, there were parts of the article that seemed to stereotype black communities. This sentence, "First they abandoned integration, leaving the schools overwhelmingly poor and black". Saying the word 'black' at the end implies that struggling communities are equal to black communities. This is a highly negative stereotype that the article reinforced. My rating is a 2 out of 5.
- Type and Color:
    - The typography was decent. There was nothing wrong with it, but nothing very remarkable either. Whenever they cited sources, they italicized them, which was good. They also put the links to sources in red text, which made it easier to identify the links. They also changed the font for captions of the images, which I think is helpful. However, there was nothing bold that drew my attention to certain parts of the article. My rating is a 3 out of 5.
    - The color used in this article was adequate. There was not a lot of it used, but the one color present was red. Red can signify danger or stopping. This was a good choice as they were discussing struggles of education in black communities, which can be considered unsafe or something that needs to be stopped. Although there was nothing that really caught my eye, it was ok. My rating is a 3 out of 5
- Creativity:
    - This article had some effective creativity. There were certain parts where images were used well. They added to the tone of the article and further enhanced their argument. For example, when discussing the racial divide in Pinellas County, they included an image of a school cafeteria where all of the students were black. This was a great addition to this section to visibly show the lack of diversity in Pinellas. On the other hand, there were instances where the visuals seemed unnecessary and distracting. For example, the image used for the heading was a photograph of students' legs facing down at the ground. I think it would have been better if the opening image showed students' faces to convey the concerned tone of the article. Another instance of this is when a section was discussing a student, Tyree Parker, who was being bullied. In this part, they showed an image of a child simply waiting outside to be picked up. His expression was relatively content. No signs were showing that he was going through a hard time, making this image confusing and unnecessary. Overall, I would say there was a mix of both useful and somewhat uneeded visuals. My rating is a 3 out of 5.

 ## Pitch Idea: College Mental Health Crisis
 Question: How are universities adapting to the rise in student mental health needs, and are those efforts effective?

- Timeliness: Post-pandemic anxiety and depression rates among students remain high. 
- People to discuss with: College students, counseling staff, and mental health advocates.
- Available data: CDC or NIH statistics on youth mental health, campus counseling center usage rates, and surveys from organizations.
