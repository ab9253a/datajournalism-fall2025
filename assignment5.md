# Writing about Data

 **. Lede:** The story opens with a summary/statistical lede paired with a benchmark hook that states that of small communities across 11 Western states, more than 500 have a higher wildfire hazard potential than Paradise, California—the town devastated by the 2018 Camp Fire. This is effective because it immediately communicates scale and stakes with a hard number and it anchors the risk by comparing to a place readers already recognize as catastrophic. The phrasing also clearly signals a data-driven investigation that will proceed beyond California to the wider West. However, “hazard potential” can be misread as “likelihood this year.” A single clarifying sentence early on about what the metric is and isn’t  would further strengthen the lede’s precision.

 **. The Data:** The investigation analyzed U.S. Forest Service wildfire-hazard modeling to rank thousands of small Western communities, concluding that 526 places (or “more than 500”) scored higher than Paradise on a 1–5 hazard scale (Paradise ≈ 3.81; median ≈ 2.07–2.08). The analysis synthesized dozens of variables and, as described in coverage of the project, ran extensive simulations to characterize potential fire behavior and community exposure. The core finding: extreme hazard potential isn’t confined to California; it’s distributed across the West, including pockets in Arizona and the Los Angeles foothills.
 Critiques: The Forest Service explicitly notes WHP depicts potential for high-intensity fire based on fuels/landscape—not loss potential or real-time threat. Translating WHP into “human risk” requires added assumptions. WHP is periodically updated and isn’t a forecast and it can change. The story is strong for a 2019 scan, but know that the rankings are not permanent.

**. Sources:** The write-up we can access quotes Phillip Levin (University of Washington/Nature Conservancy) emphasizing that disasters happen when people “didn’t know to leave, or couldn’t leave,” underscoring the story’s evacuation-constraint lens. This supports the data work linking hazard to egress, age, disability and alerts coverage. The inclusion of vulnerability details translates stats into human stakes. Overall, the sourcing strengthens the story by validating the choice to go beyond fuels into social/egress risk.

**. Story Structure:** *Inverted pyramid*- The piece front-loads the finding (“526 places outrank Paradise”), then cascades into methods and implications. *Vignette*- The series embeds on-the-ground portraits to show how topography and single-road canyons turn high hazard into real risk, humanizing the numbers. *Martini glass*- The story opens broad with the key stat, then narrows into explanatory detail and specific communities—classic martini-glass sequencing. *Circle/bookend*- The Paradise comparison that opens the piece reappears as context when discussing age/disability and evacuation, satisfying expectations set by the lede.

**. Numbers:** The scale (1–5) and the comparison to a familiar benchmark (Paradise ≈ 3.8 vs. median ≈ 2.07–2.08) are intuitive and anchor the narrative. The count “526 communities” is a sticky, memorable headline number. Mixing the WHP index (a composite of burn probability/intensity) with social metrics and evacuation constraints risks number-overload unless labels are crystal clear. A quick “hazard vs. risk” explainer in-line would help general readers track what each number means and what’s being combined.

**. Data Viz:** The project leaned on interactive maps, animated explainers, and a lookup tool so readers could find their own community—precisely the right medium for geospatial, comparative risk. The team’s own entry at the Information is Beautiful Awards explains how they combined code-driven prototyping with hand-refined visuals and shipped a searchable database/lookup, which clearly adds utility rather than decoration.

**. Methods:** The project published an “About this report” methods page detailing inputs, community selection, evacuation-route scoring, demographics, and the overall workflow, a classic methods/nerd box outside the main narrative. That’s essential for reproducibility and to draw the line between hazard (landscape fire potential) and human risk (exposure/evacuation/vulnerability). Given WHP’s own caveat (“not a threat map; not a forecast”), having that sidebar is necessary and effective. The only improvement would be surfacing one or two key caveats in the main text to prevent misinterpretation by people who simply skim the text.
